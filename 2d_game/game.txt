Let's make a 2d game that is 

Let's build up on this, by saying that this will be with simple satisfying graphics, like rectangle for player and mobs, also drag n drop UI system for inventory, quick interactions with trader by passing by the trader, it shows up the dialog buttons of "trade", "talk", "hire", there should be ability to mine ores like stone, iron, copper, silver, gold, and trader would have drag n drop ui for buying and selling, the mobs would be dropping coins or items, parts, mobs and ores would respawn also there should be trees and you can cut down trees and they regrow, there also should be grass.

It would also have stats, levels, ability to invest level points into stats, if you swing sword unto enemy/mob, it should bounce back.

There should be axe, sword, pickaxe, shovel and other items. Ability to equip armor, buy armor exchange. The mobs consist of skeletons, zombies, orcs, trolls, goblins, mouse, wolf. 

We will do it all in a single html page.
Make sure the mobs have their titles over their head.
